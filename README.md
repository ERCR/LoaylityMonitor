===============
This is a simple example of building flow w/ Pig, Flume for getting data from Twitter Streaming API into HDFS, then push result of Pig scipt into MySQL w/ Sqoop. Also, there are R scripts for prediction analytics on top of Hadoop (it was first time I faced R language and streaming on Hadoop).

Just for fun, I used tightly coupling of components in workflow instead of Oozie.
